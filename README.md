# docker-mysql
Project to create/start MySQL server in a docker container with my own docker-compose setup e.g parameters and configuration.

It uses the official Docker MySQL image with a helpful script to start the container.

Modify config/mysql/envlist.txt with the necessary settings.

Use the start.sh script to start the container.
